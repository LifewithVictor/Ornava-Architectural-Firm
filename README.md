1) Title & Objective

Technology Choice: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion
Justification:
React with TypeScript provides a robust, type-safe foundation for building maintainable component-based UIs.
Vite offers lightning-fast development and optimized production builds.
Tailwind CSS enables rapid, consistent styling with a custom brown/stone palette perfectly suited to an elegant architecture portfolio.
Framer Motion adds smooth, professional animations with minimal code overhead.
The stack is lightweight, modern, and widely adopted in 2025 for high-quality portfolio sites.

End Goal: A fully functional, responsive single-page architecture portfolio website with hero section, project gallery (with modal), testimonials, contact form, dark/light mode, and smooth navigation – ready for deployment and easy customization.

2) Quick Summary of the Technology

Definition: A modern frontend stack combining React (UI library), TypeScript (static typing), Vite (build tool), Tailwind CSS (utility-first styling), and Framer Motion (animation library).
Use Cases: Commonly used in the industry for portfolio websites, marketing pages, SaaS landing pages, and any design-focused web application requiring performance, responsiveness, and visual polish.
Real-World Example: Sites like those of award-winning architecture firms (e.g., Zaha Hadid Architects, BIG – Bjarke Ingels Group) or creative agencies often use similar React/Tailwind stacks for their clean, animated, image-heavy portfolios.
